# Heart Disease Prediction: Healthcare Data Analytics

## Overview

This project aims to predict heart disease using healthcare data analytics. The goal is to leverage machine learning (ML) tools to identify independent variables and risk factors that are crucial for predicting heart disease. The target is a binary classification where "0" indicates no heart disease and "1" indicates the presence of heart disease.

## Mission Statement
Maximizing human longevity, healthier communities, and optimal health outcomes through data-driven patient-centered Healthcare Analytics.

1. **Data Preparation and Analysis**:
   - Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, which includes 303 observations and 13 variables with no missing values.
   - Identifying key variables such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, and fasting blood sugar.

2. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Analyzing the statistical significance of key variables.
   - Visualizing data to highlight correlations among variables like age, cholesterol, and blood pressure.

3. **Machine Learning Model Implementation**:
   - Implementing various ML models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics like ROC curves, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
   - Ensuring the Gradient Boosting model, which showed the highest accuracy at 86.8%, is fine-tuned for optimal performance.

4. **Findings and Recommendations**:
   - Presenting findings to healthcare stakeholders including doctors, clinical personnel, and patients.
   - Emphasizing the significant correlations such as age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.
   - Highlighting the impact of involving all stakeholders in patient care to minimize the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

## Conclusion

The project identifies critical risk factors for heart disease and demonstrates the effectiveness of ML models in predicting heart disease. By focusing on data-driven insights and involving all stakeholders, it aims to improve patient outcomes and contribute to the field of healthcare analytics.
